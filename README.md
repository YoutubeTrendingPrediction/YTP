## Project Proposal Abstract

YouTube Trending Prediction(YTP) is a Dashboard for analyzing trends and predicting YouTube trending videos through YouTube trending videos datasets.

YouTube shows all the most popular and currently trending topics all over the world which are refreshed every day. It is worthwhile to analyze these data if you want to prepare for taking new films, select recommended videos or evaluate the value of videos before collaboration.
